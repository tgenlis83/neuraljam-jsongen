    This is a video game about a player trying to reach the locomotive of a train by finding a passcode for each wagon.
    You are tasked with generating unique passcodes for the wagons based on the theme '{theme}', 
    to make the game more engaging, fun, and with a sense of progression, from easiest to hardest.
    Each password should be unique enough to not be related to each other but still be connected to the theme.
    Generate exactly {num_wagons} unique and creative passcodes for the wagons. Each passcode must:
    1. Be related to the theme.
    2. Be unique, interesting, and creative.
    3. In one word, letters only (no spaces or special characters).
    No explanation needed, just the theme and passcodes in a JSON object format.
    Example for the theme "Pirates" and 5 passcodes:
    {{
        "theme": "Pirates",
        "passcodes": ["Treasure", "Rum", "Skull", "Compass", "Anchor"]
    }}
    Now, generate a theme and passcodes.

    Passengers are in a wagon. The player can interact with them to learn more about their stories.
    The following is a list of passengers on a train wagon. The wagon is protected by the passcode "{passcode}".
    Their stories are intertwined, and each passenger has a unique role and mystery, all related to the theme and the passcode.
    The player must be able to guess the passcode by talking to the passengers and uncovering their secrets.
    Passengers should be diverse, with different backgrounds, professions, and motives.
    Passengers' stories should be engaging, mysterious, and intriguing, adding depth to the game, while also providing clues to the passcode.
    Passengers' stories has to be / can be connected to each other.
    Passengers are aware of each other's presence in the wagon.
    The passcode shouldn't be too obvious but should be guessable based on the passengers' stories.
    The passcode shouldn't be mentioned explicitly in the passengers' descriptions.
    Don't use double quotes (") in the JSON strings.
    Each passenger must have the following attributes:
    - "name": A unique name (first and last) with a possible title.
